						<h1><i>Who we are:</i></h1>
						<p>Grassy Park Rowing Club is a development program that aims to grow the sport of rowing in under-resourced communities. We coach high school students predominantly from under-resourced backgrounds in the Grassy Park, Zeekoevlei, and Lotus River areas, but are always eager to take on new recruits from other areas.</p>

						<p>The club, founded in November of 2014, is based in Zeekoevlei at the Zeekoe Vlei Yatch Club. We are a competitive club, competing yearly at the South African Schools Rowing Championships and the South African National Rowing Championships (junior) with excellent results so far.</p>

						<p>Anyone between and including the ages of 13 and 18  interested in joining the club please see the <a href='#'>"Contact Us"</a> page.<p>

						<h1>Our Mission:</h1>
						<p>Inspire young people (especially those from under-resourced backgrounds) to be confident in themselves and their aspirations, resilient in achieving their goals, and disciplined in mastering an effective balance between work and relaxation in their lives. We seek to grow loyal ambassadors of social tolerance, integrity, and community.</p>                                                                                                       
						<p>This mission is approached by offering high school students the physical, mental, and emotional benefits that come with participating in the sport of rowing within the environment created at Grassy Park Rowing Club.</p>

			<h1>WHY WE ROW...</h1>

			<h2>Quotes from the GPRC rowers:</h2>

			<q>I row because I am forced to, not by myself or anyone else for that matter, but by my body and mind, and more so my heart</q><br> <br>

			<q>Once catches touch the water and my handles reach my chest, I know I made the right choice</q><br> <br>
			
			<q>I row because I am in love with GPRC, my crew is my family</q><br> <br>

			<q>At first I started rowing because I heard it would help get me into university, but as I attended sessions I developed a passion for this sport and now it plays an important role in keeping my life in order</q><br> <br>

			<q>I row because I just love the intense competitive nature of it, and, of course, the fun</q><br> <br>

			<q>...because I feel happy and proud, like I've finally done something with my life</q><br> <br>
